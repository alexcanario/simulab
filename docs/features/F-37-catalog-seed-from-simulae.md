# Catalog seed from Simulae

## Summary
Bring Simulae's municipal guard content (`GuardaMunicipalContentSeed`) into the new model as seeded organizers, exams and editions, so the epics that follow have real data instead of invented rows. The data has to be remapped: Simulae has no edition and no assessment type, and its names are Portuguese. The seed comes with its tests, as Simulae's does.
