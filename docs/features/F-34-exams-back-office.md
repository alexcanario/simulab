# Exams back office

## Summary
Admin screens to create, edit and remove an exam under an organizer: its name, its assessment type (public service exam, certification, university entrance exam, ENEM), its scope and the language of its content (ADR-0001 #27). Brings the parent picker the catalog needs, converted from Simulae's `ExamBoardSelect` into the UI kit. Source in Simulae: `Exam`, `ContestListPage`, `RegisterExamPage`. Needs /agile:screen.
