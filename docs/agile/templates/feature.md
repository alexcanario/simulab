One file per feature. Save as: docs/features/F-<number>-<slug>.md
Status flow: idea -> refining -> approved -> building -> validating -> done
- cancelled: exit from idea or refining only, as a duplicate; the file stays, with "Duplicate of <id> (<date>): <where the improvement went>" under the header.
- idea: title, summary and start only (/agile:idea, /agile:epic).
- refining: sections below filled during /agile:refine.
- approved: set only after the product owner says "approve F-<number>" and Open questions is empty or deferred.
- building / validating / done: set by /agile:build and /agile:ship.
- blocked: set by `/agile:change <id> --block "<reason>"` from refining, approved, building or validating; the line `Blocked (<date>): <what stops it> — unblocked by <who> — returns to <status>` sits under the header and `--unblock` returns the item to that status.

# <Feature name>

Technical terms: [glossary](../glossary.md)

## Summary
<!-- 2-3 lines captured from the chat. -->

## Start
<!-- What this item needs before it can start, and how to run it. Filled when the item is created, confirmed at refinement. -->
- Depends on: <items that must be done first: F-/B- ids, an epic, an item in another repository — or "nothing">
- Waits on (to start): <what stops the work from starting and is not an item: an owner decision, a person or team, an access, an environment — who provides it — or "nothing">
- Needed to validate: <what only the validation needs (a real clone, an environment, a person or device) — who provides it — or "nothing"; never blocks a start or an approval>
- Suggested path: <`/agile:refine` → `/agile:build` | `/agile:autopilot <id>` (small and clear) | `/agile:discuss` first (open direction) | `/agile:screen` during refinement>
- Parallel with: <ids that can run at the same time in a worktree — or "none">
